An individual project that I created when I was teaching myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and some javascript to implement basic functionalities of my website.
This project creates a basic personal dashboard that shows the current date and time, the ability to add items to a to-do list and to check them off as needed, an inspirational quote that cycles through a list of my favorites, and the
ability to toggle between light and darkmode.
